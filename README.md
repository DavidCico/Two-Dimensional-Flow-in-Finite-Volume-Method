# Passive scalar transport in a 2D flow using Finite Volume Method (FVM)
This code is a FORTRAN implementation of a 2D flow using FVM. The flow of a passive scalar is modelled, and visualization of the field is done with Paraview.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The code being implemented in Fortran 90, and Fortran being a compiled language, it requires a compiler such as <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">GFortran</a>.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install GFortran like this:

    sudo apt-get install gfortran
    
Alongside the GFortran compiler, the open-source platform for data analysis and visualization, <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>, is also required and installed through the commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install paraview

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at:

https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries for GFortran
https://www.paraview.org/download/ for ParaView


## File descriptions

* 'ETF_data' which is a univariate time series of the price history of the ETF.
* 'Main.py' which contains the main procedure, as well as the data pre-processing of the xlsx file 'ETF_data.xlsx'
* 'Monte_Carlo_GBM.py' which contains the different algorithms used for comparison.
* 'Post_processing.py' where all the functions for post-processing (plots, information, descriptive statistics) are implemented.

### Running the program

The code is ready to be used and just requires running the following command:

    $ python Main.py

The code is well commented and easy to understand. The different parameters calculated and used for the simulations are:
``` python
# S0 corresponds to the starting price of the stock
# sigma is the daily volatility
# mu correponds to the mean daily returns
# T is the number of years for the simulation
# n_days is the number of days of the simulation
# dt corresponds to the timestep of 1 day
# n_ETF corresponds to the number of ETF held
S0 = ETF_data.close[-1]
sigma = annual_sigma
mu = annual_return
T = 10
dt = 1/trading_days_per_year
n_ETF = 10000 / S0

# num_iterations is the number of times the random process is repeated (Monte Carlo simulations)
num_iterations = 100
```

After all simulations have been run, different graphs are generated to analyse the return of investment, as well as its variance. The 2 images below show some of the plots generated by the code.
